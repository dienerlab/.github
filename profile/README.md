We are a lab led by Christian Diener at the [Medical University of Graz](https://medunigraz.at) and
study the human gut microbiome through an approach that combines ecology, systems biology,
and metabolism. We are also big fans of equitable and accessible Science and
participate in various efforts to share our research, software, and teaching materials.

Like us, microbes rarely live alone and may behave quite differently when around
others or in a new environment. We are interested in the complex metabolic interactions taking place between
microbes, the host, and their environment, and how those can be leveraged to understand and design complex microbial
communities. We mainly use computational strategies but also run experiments in our
wetlab.

The lab forms part of the Austrian FWF Cluster of Excellence
[*Microbiomes Drive Planetary Health*](https://microplanet.at/) and collaborates with other
researchers and industry all across the globe. If you are interested in learning more feel
